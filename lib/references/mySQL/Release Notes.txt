Connector/Net 6.1  Release Notes
------------------------------------

Welcome to the release notes for Connector/Net 6.1

What's new in 6.1
--------------------
This release introduces a couple of exciting new features.

Website Configuration Dialog -- This is a new wizard that is activated by clicking
a button on the toolbar at the top of the solution explorer.  It is meant to work in
conjunction with the ASP.Net administration pages.  It makes it easier to activate 
and set advanced options for the different web providers we include.

Session State Provider -- We are now including a session state provider that allows
you to store your websites state in a MySql server.  

Support for native output parameters -- With this release we now support native output
parameters when connected to a server that supports them.  Currently we know that includes
6.0.8 and later servers.  It also will include 5.4 servers.

Changed GUID type -- We have changed our backend representation of a guid type to be
CHAR(36).  We are doing this because we feel users will want to use the server UUID() function
to populate a guid table and UUID generates a 36 character string.  Developers of older
applications can add 'old guids=true' to the connection string and the old binary(16) type will be used.

Functionality changes
----------------------------
We are now treating the command builder just like SqlClient.  This means that if you want to
return an autoincrement value back to your dataset, you will need to clone the generated command
and manually add the proper SQL onto the end of your command text.  The command builder 
was not designed to handle this.  In previous versions we have tried to support this but
it is causing more headaches than it is solving.

Please let us know what else we broke and how we can make it better!
