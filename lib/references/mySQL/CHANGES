Version 6.1.3

- in sessionState provider, timeout value was read from the wrong (root) web.config (bug#47815)
- fixed crash that can occur when oldGuids are used and binary(16) column  used for GUID 
  contains a null value (thanks Troy!) (bug#47928)
- fixed indexes schema collection so that it still works with bad table names such as b``a`d (bug #48101)
