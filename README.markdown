# INFO
## Overview
RoundhousE is an automated database deployment (change management) system that allows you to use your current idioms and gain much more. Currently works with Oracle, SQL Server (2000/2005/2008/Express), Access, MySQL, SQLite and PostgreSQL.There are future plans for other databases.  
  
It seeks to solve both maintenance concerns and ease of deployment. We follow some of the same idioms as other database management systems (SQL scripts), but we are different in that we think about future maintenance concerns. We want to always apply certain scripts (anything stateless like functions, views, stored procedures, and permissions), so we don't have to throw everything into our change scripts. This seeks to solves future source control concerns. How sweet is it when you can version the database according to your current source control version?  
  
## Getting started with RoundhousE
### Downloads
 You can download RoundhousE from [http://code.google.com/p/roundhouse/downloads/list](http://code.google.com/p/roundhouse/downloads/list)  

 You can also obtain a copy from the build server at [http://teamcity.codebetter.com](http://teamcity.codebetter.com).  
  
### Gems  
If you have Ruby 1.8.6+ (and Gems 1.3.7+) installed, you can get the current release of RoundhousE to your machine quickly!  
  
1. Type `gem install roundhouse`  
2. Then from anywhere you can type `rh [options]`  
  
### NuGet  
With NuGet you can get the current release of RoundhousE to your application quickly!  
  
1. In Visual Studio Package Manager Console type `install-package roundhouse`  
2. There is also `roundhouse.lib`, `roundhouse.msbuild`, and `roundhouse.refreshdatabase`  
  
### Chocolatey  
Chocolatey is like apt-get, but for Windows! This is an alternative method to get the current release of RoundhousE to your machine quickly!  
  
1. Type `cinst roundhouse`  
2. Then from anywhere you can type `rh [options]`  
  
### Source
This is the best way to get to the bleeding edge of what we are doing.  

1. Clone the source down to your machine.  
  `git clone git://github.com/chucknorris/roundhouse.git`  
2. Type `cd roundhouse`  
3. Type `git config core.autocrlf false` to leave line endings as they are.  
4. Type `git status`. You should not see any files to change.
5. Run `build.bat`. NOTE: You must have git on the path (open a regular command line and type git).
  
  
# REQUIREMENTS

### Breaking Changes

  + RoundhousE will change the DB recover mode if the `recoverymode` mode option is explicitly set to `simple` or `full`. In the past, RoundhousE would default to `full` but would only ever set the recovery mode while creating/restoring the database. If you depended on RoundhousE to create/restore the database for you and you don't want the database server default to be used, you should specify the recovery mode option.

## 0.8.5  
* FIX: KeyNotFoundException in NHibernateSessionFactoryBuilder. See [issue 59] (http://code.google.com/p/roundhouse/issues/detail?id=59) for details. (r361)  
* **SQLite Support!**. See details https://github.com/chucknorris/roundhouse/issues/21 (r360)  
* **PostgreSQL Support!** Thanks SiimV! See details https://github.com/chucknorris/roundhouse/issues/30 (r359)  
* **New Configuration Switch!** SearchAllSubdirectoriesInsteadOfTraverse - All migrations subfolders are traversed by default and run in order of each folder's scripts. This option runs all items in subfolders at same time. Thanks SiimV! See details https://github.com/chucknorris/roundhouse/issues/31 (r359)  
* FIX: Transactions not working with restore. See details https://github.com/chucknorris/roundhouse/issues/26 (r357)  
* FIX: Fixed a nasty bug with SQL Server where it tries to hold a connection (interferes with drop/create mode) and gives a transport error. See details https://github.com/chucknorris/roundhouse/issues/12 (r357)  
* **New Version Resolver!** - Script Number Versioning. See details https://github.com/chucknorris/roundhouse/pull/25 (r356)  
* FIX: Custom create script should split batch statements. See details https://github.com/chucknorris/roundhouse/issues/22 (r353)  
* **New Migrations Folder!** RunAfterCreateDatabaseFolder - Runs only one time and only after a database has been created. This works with a limited set of database types at the moment. Please test if you are planning on using. See details https://github.com/chucknorris/roundhouse/issues/20 (r351)  
* Almost everything is now ilmerged internalized. See details https://github.com/chucknorris/roundhouse/issues/8 and https://github.com/chucknorris/roundhouse/issues/15 (r350)  
* FIX: Cannot drop databases with snapshots. See details https://github.com/chucknorris/roundhouse/pull/13 (r349)  
* Create database custom script can handle file paths. See details https://github.com/chucknorris/roundhouse/pull/17 (r348)  
* FIX: SQL Server 2000 needs to create all of its tables. See details https://github.com/chucknorris/roundhouse/issues/18 (r346)  
* RH assemblies are now signed. See details https://github.com/chucknorris/roundhouse/issues/14 (r342)  
* FIX: Removed the temporary log location. See details https://github.com/chucknorris/roundhouse/issues/7 (r340)  
* **New Configuration Switch!** DisableTokenReplacement - Token replacement should be configurable. See [issue 56](http://code.google.com/p/roundhouse/issues/detail?id=56) for details. (r339)  
* FIX: Token replacer should only replace for items it finds. See [issue 56](http://code.google.com/p/roundhouse/issues/detail?id=56) for details. (r339)  
* **Possible Breaking Change!** File encoding will always try to read files as UTF-8, but fall back to ANSI. You can't go wrong if you encode in ANSI. See [issue 39](http://code.google.com/p/roundhouse/issues/detail?id=39) for details. (r337)  
* Restores are a bit smarter about moving files to a default location when one has not been specified. See details https://github.com/chucknorris/roundhouse/issues/9 or [issue 13](http://code.google.com/p/roundhouse/issues/detail?id=13) (r336)  
* FIX: Do not run token replacement on empty text. See details https://github.com/chucknorris/roundhouse/issues/10 (r330)  
* Custom Scripts also run token replacement (r321)  
* **New Configuration Switches!** Two new switches available - CommandTimeout and CommandTimeoutAdmin! (r329)

* **New Migrations Folder!** Indexes folder now available (r327)  
* **New Migrations Folder!** AlterDatabase folder now available. See details https://github.com/chucknorris/roundhouse/issues/6 (r324)

* RH now does token replacement in the sql files using '{{PropertyName}}'. See [issue 33] (http://code.google.com/p/roundhouse/issues/detail?id=33) for details. (r299)  
* Always run files that have '.EVERYTIME.' in the name. See [issue 51] (http://code.google.com/p/roundhouse/issues/detail?id=51) for details. (r299)

* MSBuild is available again. (r288)

## 0.7.0.276  
* Fixed a collation issue with RoundhousE id columns in its tracking tables. See [issue 46] (http://code.google.com/p/roundhouse/issues/detail?id=46) for details. (r274)  
* RestoreFromPath can take a relative path. (r269)  
* RH can now upgrade it's internals without user interaction. See [issue 40] (http://code.google.com/p/roundhouse/issues/detail?id=40) for details. (r268)  
* MSBuild / NAnt tasks are deprecated and no longer hooked up. Please use the console and call it from your tasks. (r268)

* RH has differencing support with RedGate. See sample project for details. (r197)
